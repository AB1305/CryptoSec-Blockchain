# CryptoSec-Blockchain

This project is a comprehensive exploration of blockchain technology and cybersecurity. It involves two main components:
1. Creating a cryptocurrency system using blockchain.
2. Demonstrating SQL injection vulnerabilities and implementing mitigation techniques.

## Project Overview
1. **Phase 1: Creating a Cryptocurrency System**
   - Developed a blockchain-based cryptocurrency.
   - Used **Python** and **Flask** for backend development.
   - Implemented **smart contracts** using Solidity deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.
   - Designed a user-friendly web interface for managing accounts, viewing balances, and performing transactions.

2. **Phase 2: SQL Injection and Mitigation**
   - Introduced intentional SQL injection vulnerabilities in the system to demonstrate their impact.
   - Showcased various SQL injection techniques, including:
     - Classic SQL injection
     - Blind SQL injection
     - Error-based SQL injection
   - Mitigated vulnerabilities using parameterized queries, prepared statements, and advanced input validation techniques.
   - Enhanced the security of the application to prevent unauthorized database access.

## Features
- **Cryptocurrency System**:
  - A blockchain ledger for secure and transparent transactions.
  - SHA-256 encryption for data integrity.
  - A secure user registration and authentication system.
- **SQL Injection Demonstration**:
  - Step-by-step examples of vulnerabilities and their exploitation.
- **SQL Injection Mitigation**:
  - Implementation of secure coding practices.
  - Input sanitization and database query optimization.
- **Web Interface**:
  - User-friendly platform for account management and cryptocurrency transactions.

## Technologies Used
- **Blockchain Development**: Python, Solidity, MetaMask
- **Web Development**: Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database Management**: MySQL
- **Security Enhancements**: SHA-256, Prepared Statements
